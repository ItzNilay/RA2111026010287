The task is to create a production-level microservice that calculates the average of numbers fetched from a test server based on given qualifiers (prime, Fibonacci, even, random). The microservice maintains a sliding window of fixed size, ensuring efficient response times and adherence to specified constraints.

Second task was creating a public API that aggregates top products from five e-commerce companies, allowing users to compare offerings. Users can specify category, price range, and sorting options. Ensure timely responses, pagination for large results, unique product identifiers, and adaptability to changes in e-commerce data.
